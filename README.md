# Installation

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ZimCodes/doki-theme-icons-jetbrains/releases/latest)
- Install it by going to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from
  disk...</kbd>

# Usage

You can access the settings menu here:

<kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Appearance & Behavior</kbd> > <kbd>Doki Theme Icon</kbd>

### Sync with Doki Theme

This option is only enabled when you have this plugin &
the [Doki Theme for JetBrains IDEs](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains#the-doki-theme-jetbrains-ides)
installed.
When enabled, when you change your current theme to another Doki theme, the icon theme will sync with the current theme.

Turning this option off will give you the ability to use a different theme other than for the one was intended.
I do not know why you would want to that, because I specially designed each one to fit each Doki theme perfectly :)

### Icon Settings

- **UI Icons** Are all the icons that are present as part of the user interface (UI).

<!--
- **Named Files** Turns on the ability for the plugin to associate various names of files to various icons. This is only used for when the platform does not already provide a special icon for the file.
-->

- **File Glyphs** Are the icons in the project tree & completion window which symbolize the abstract programming
  concepts. Such as: Interfaces, Classes, Methods, Variables etc.
- **My Icons** Are a special set of icons that do not necessarily fit the general icon theme, but have special meaning
  to me.

# Miscellaneous

## Attribution Requirements

As an open source project, attribution is critical from a legal, practical and motivational perspective in my opinion.
The graphics are licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 which has a pretty good guide
on [best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution).

However, I consider the guide a bit onerous and as a project, and will accept a mention in a project README or an '
About' section or footer on a website. In mobile applications, a common place would be in the Settings/About section. I
would consider a mention in the HTML/JS source sufficient also.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to create a pull request with your ideas!

Some ways to contribute:
- Create new icons. 
  - Here's an [Icon TODO List](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-icons/blob/main/todo) created by Unthrottled which includes icons to be added in future versions.
- Add cool new features 
- Update existing themes and icons providing that doki vibe
- Create a new theme entirely
